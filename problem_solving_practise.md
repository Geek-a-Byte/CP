## How to practice CP

<h5>⚫ Rating 1000 → 1400, from a beginner to a specialist
<h5>⚫ Rating 1400 → 1900, from a specialist to a top 10% coder
<h5>⚫ Rating 1900 → 2200, from a top 10% coder to a well-played Div1 player
<h5>⚫ Rating 2200 → 2400, from a well-played Div1 player to red
  
## Practice at Atcoder
  
<h5>There are 3 types of contests in AtCoder:
<h5>⚫ AtCoder Beginner Contest (ABC): There are 4 problems.
<h5>➢ The difficulty in ABC is generally R500 – R700 – R900 – R1400 in Codeforces difficulty.
<h5>⚫ AtCoder Regular Contest (ARC): There are 4 problems. Usually, the first two problems of ARC and the last two problems of ABC are the same.
<h5>➢ The difficulty in ARC is generally R900 – R1400 – R2100 – R2600 in Codeforces difficulty, but it may differ by contest.
<h5>⚫ AtCoder Grand Contest (AGC): There are 6 problems.
<h5>➢ The difficulty in AGC is generally R1200 – R1900 – R2200 – R2500 – R3000 –R3300 in Codeforces difficulty,

## 3-1. Practice Skills – From Rating 1000 to 1400 - from gray/green coders to cyan/blue coder

### three things are needed for being rating 1400

<h5>⚫ You can write straight-forward simulation fast. (within 5-10 minutes)
<h5>⚫ You can write brute force fast. (within 5-10 minutes)
<h5>⚫ You can divide the problem into some cases in your brain or in your paper. (e.g. N=2, N=3, or N>=4)

for this, solve problem B or C in AtCoder Beginner Contest. In problem B, you can learn how to write simulations and brute force faster. In problem C, you can learn how to consider the solution and the efficient way to use paper (or notebook) to think about solution.
  
## important points when you solve problems in AtCoder

  read editorial after

- 15 minutes’ thinking if problem B
- 30 minutes’ thinking if problem C
- look some source codes written by high-rated coders
- when you solve problem C, I recommend you to use paper to consider.Using whiteboard instead of paper is also good.
  
## 3-2. Practice Skills – From Rating 1400 to 1900

To be rating 1900, skills as follows are needed:
  if you know and can use this algos:

- [ ] Brute force
- [ ] DP
- [ ] DFS
- [ ] BFS
- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Binary Indexed Tree
- [ ] nCr, nPr
- [ ] Mod inverse
- [ ] Bitmasks
- [ ] Binary Search
  
if you can code faster (For example, 5 minutes for R1100 problems, 10 minutes for R1400 problems) Fast coding is very important for Codeforces because generally, if there is a wide gap of difficulty in a contest, fast coding affects rating very much.

## for fast-coding and fast-debugging

  On average, if you can solve problem C of AtCoder Beginner Contest within 10 minutes and problem D within 20 minutes, you are Div1 in FastCodingForces :) . If you are not good at solving more than R1400 in Codeforces, you should learn some algorithms above and solve typical problems in Codeforces.
  
  If you are good at solving problems but did not perform well in real contests, you should do virtual contests more. Do you know Virtual Contest system in Codeforces? You can do virtual participation!

## 3-3. Practice Skills – From Rating 1900 to 2200
  
 for this, you should solve a lot of difficult problems. (e.g. R1900 or more in Codeforces). Sadly, there was a lot of coders which travelling between blue and purple.

To be rating 2200, skills as follows are needed:
<h5>⚫ You know and can use 10 algorithms which I stated in pp.11 and segment trees (including lazy propagations)
<h5>⚫ You can solve problems very fast: For example, 5 mins for R1100, 10 mins for R1500, 15 mins for R1800, 40 mins for R2000.
<h5>⚫ You have decent skills for mathematical-thinking or considering problems
<h5>⚫ Strong mental which can think about the solution more than 1 hours, and don’t give up even if you are below average in Div1 in the middle of the contest
  
#### virtual contest does not mean “Virtual Participation” in Codeforces. It means choosing 4 or 5 problems which the difficulty is near your rating (For example, if you are rating 2000, choose R2000 problems in Codeforces) and solve them within 2 hours.You can use <https://vjudge.net/>

#### To solve problem fast, you should equip some coding library (or template code). For example, I think that equipping segment tree libraries, lazy segment tree libraries,modint library, FFT library, geometry library, etc. is very effective
  
## 4. Recommendation of virtual contests

Before writing about recommendation of virtual contests, I think that there are two types
of virtual contests as follows:
<h5>⚫ Virtual Participation: Choose the contests and solve problems as if it is a real contest. As same as Codeforces Virtual Participation system.
<h5>⚫ Virtual Contest: Use https://vjudge.net/ or some other judges. Choose some problems which fit your rating from Codeforces, and upsolve within 2-3 hours.At first, I will recommend both types of virtual contests.For virtual participation, I think that you can learn about strategy, mental, and some other kinds of contest skills. For virtual contest, I think that you can concentrate more than solving single problem, so the efficiency of solving/reviewing will increase.That’s why when I upsolve some difficult problems in Codeforces, I always use https://vjudge.net/ and make virtual contests.

Almost every day, do Codeforces virtual participation for 2-3 hours. After the contest, read the editorial and solution of legendary grandmasters, and write reviews for 1 hours.
<h5>⚫ Sometimes (around once a week), choose ~5 problem from Codeforces (Difficulties are R2200-R2800) and solve within 2-4 hours.
<h5>⚫ Although I experienced competitive programming for 3 years, I think that I don’t know many techniques (not actually as same as typical) so I always read editorial if I could not solve problems which had solved by >20 people during actual contest.
